The above are input parameters for bend_knots.m. These parameters can be modified in this file

The first parameter specifies a choice of bend knot, and the rest are material parameters described as follows:

(a) Choice of bend knot:
This is a number n from 1 to 22. It picks out the nth knot from the following list:

reef,       thief,      granny,     grief,      bowline13,  bowline14, 
bowline24,  bowline23,  carrick13,  carrick14,  hunter13,   hunter14,  
hunter24,   hunter23,   zeppelin13, zeppelin14, zeppelin23, ashley13,  
ashley14,   alpine13,   alpine24,   alpine23

(b) Including material parameters, input parameters are given in order with units below:

Choice of bend knot, Radius (mm), Bending modulus (GPa), Young's modulus (GPa), Poisson's ratio, Pulling force (N)

E.g. the above input parameters (top line) correspond to: 

Reef knot, Radius = 0.2mm, Bending modulus = 0.1 GPa, etc.
